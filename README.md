<h2>Summary</h2>

This project uses Computer Vision to determine if a grocery store can figure out age by photo at a self-checkout for restricted items. It includes Exploratory Data Analysis and also uses ResNet50 as the model, with recommendations at the end.

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

      1. Exploratory Data Analysis(notebooks > EDA_ML.ipynb)
            a) Library importation
            b) Import the data
            c) EDA - Age Distributions of the Photos
            d) EDA - Examining Sample Photos
      
      2. Machine Learning Models (notebooks > EDA_ML.ipynb)
            a) Functions to load and split the data
            b) Function to create the model
            c) Function to train the model
            d) Script to run all the functions
            e) GPU Output and Final MAE
            f) Conclusions

<h2>Local Access</h2>

This project needs to be run on the GPU of your choice and requires tensorflow in the most recent version.

Because a GPU is required, no local installation of Python is required. The GPU will use Python appropriately. This was written using Python 3.11.5. If a GPU is not readily available, Google Colab. 

<h2>Plans for Updates</h2>

There are no plans for updates at this time
